# Linting rules

## Mistakes

- `no-anchor-in-root-scope`: (warning) should be either an incrementor or regular tabstop
- `no-indexed-tabstop`: (warning) use incrementors whenever possible
- `no-invalid-anchor`: Anchor doesn't have a valid reference (reference)
- `self-referencing-expansion` (error): Can't use a self reference in an expansion or expanded children
- `unclosed-element` (error): Bracket must be closed
